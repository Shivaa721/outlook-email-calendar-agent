# Outlook Email & Calendar Agent

## Overview
This project is an automation agent built using **n8n** that manages Outlook **email and calendar operations** through natural language instructions.

The system uses an **orchestrator-based design** to route user requests to the correct action, such as sending emails or managing calendar events.

## What This Agent Can Do
- Send, reply to, draft, and delete Outlook emails
- Create, update, retrieve, and delete calendar events
- Handle scheduling requests using natural language
- Maintain session-based context for conversations
- Prevent duplicate events and manage conflicts

## Architecture
- Orchestrator Agent: Identifies intent and routes tasks
- Email Agent: Handles all email-related operations
- Calendar Agent: Manages calendar scheduling and updates

## Tech Stack
- n8n (Workflow Automation)
- Microsoft Outlook API
- Calendar API
- OpenAI (for intent interpretation)

## Use Cases
- Personal productivity automation
- Executive assistant systems
- Enterprise email and scheduling workflows

## How It Works
1. User provides a natural language instruction
2. Orchestrator determines whether it is an email or calendar task
3. Task is delegated to the appropriate agent
4. Action is executed and confirmed

## Notes
- This repository contains an exported **n8n workflow (JSON)**.
- The workflow is designed for real-world automation scenarios.
